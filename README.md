# Catsay

Welcome to **Catsay**! Inspired by the classic `cowsay`, Catsay is a fun and whimsical command-line tool that displays
ASCII art of a cat along with a custom message. Whether you're looking to add a bit of feline flair to your terminal or
just need a smile, Catsay has got you covered!

## Features

- üê± **Adorable ASCII Cat**: Displays a cute cat that "says" your message.
- üí¨ **Custom Messages**: Input any text for the cat to say.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Simple Command-Line Interface**: Lightweight and easy to use.
- üé® **Customizable**: Modify the ASCII art or text formatting to your liking.

## Download

Compile it yourself using CMake or download the latest release for your operating system from
the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Altiran/catsay/releases).

## Usage

Using Catsay is as easy as typing a single command. Just pass your message as an argument:

```bash
./catsay "Hello, world!"
```

And you'll see your message displayed with an adorable ASCII cat.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of Catsay in action:

```bash
$ ./catsay "I'm a cat!"
```
